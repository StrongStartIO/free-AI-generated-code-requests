# Welcome to Our Public Beta of @Cloud AI package. 

This is what a true MVP state looks like. 

## TLDR:
My name is Jon Senterfitt @thetwosents on Twitter or @StrongStarter. We have built a community of developer talent focused on progressing adoption of new tech with ethics, morals, and integrity from the transaction layer to the interaction layer. 

## We need your help!
To train AI and to train our teams with the AI, we need challenges to solve! These can be small things like Metamask login scripts, etc, to very complex/abstract things like...Time dialation. 

This is an open beta test of some of our internal tooling that we are bringing to market. We are willing to take on whatever challenge you have. 

Create an issue describing your problem, We will post the solution on the issue. 

Keep It Simple Stupid.

Bonus points if it's a user story that accurately details some functionality you are trying to accomplish.
